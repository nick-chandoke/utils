;; is xdg-open. however, xdg-open doesn't account for whether
;; the program is interactive or not.

;; TODO:
;; include auto-interactivity based on program name.
  ;; sometimes leave fzf open while an interactive child process runs (e.g. mplayer)
;; fails when file name contains single quotes. might also fail for other particular characters

;; e.g. (P #f (Î» (x) (P x port->string "tr h z")) "echo" "hi")
;; if you want synchronous processes, set current input/output ports, and use system*.
;; TODO: i don't use this function at all; i use its body explicitly in order to
;; close the input port later. make that more elegant
